{
    "Obstacles Height": (Integer) Code will divide screen height with this this number, and sets it to the obstacle height.
                        for example, 2 - will create obstacles with half screen height
    "Obstacles Width": (Integer) Consider that player width is around 100 px, so obstacle with 200 px width  is pretty small.
                        400 is normal.
    "Obstacle Gap": (Integer) The gap between obstacles. Again, consider player width. 400 is normal.
    "Obstacles Speed Increment": (Integer) The obstacles speed increment in constant routine.
                                 2 consider pretty fast.
    "Obstacles Initial Speed": (Integer) The obstacles initial speed - will remain the same if speed increment is 0.
                                4 consider normal.
    "Random Height": (Integer) Make random height for each obstacle. difficulty between 0 - 10 ,
    "Color": color in integer - will be replace with relevant image
